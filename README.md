Food Trucks: Mark Lakewood


What is this?
-------------

Its a little app that I like to use to experiment with things. It has enough tricky stuff in it that you can explore how to do things, but not so much you get boged down with technical nitty gritty. 

[Ive successfully ported it to clojure as well.][1]
